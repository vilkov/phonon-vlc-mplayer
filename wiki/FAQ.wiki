Here some common answers to common questions.

If you are using the MPlayer backend, you can check [http://smplayer.wiki.sourceforge.net/FAQ SMPlayer FAQ], you will find useful informations since SMPlayer uses MPlayer

=== Which backend for which use? ===
Under Windows and Linux, for video playback, I currently recommend the MPlayer backend. For music playback I recommend the !DirectShow backend under Windows. You can also check ffdshow when using the !DirectShow backend under Windows.

=== Aero (Windows Vista) is disabled with the MPlayer backend ===
This is a known issue, cf http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.mplayer.devel/48973
A solution is to use the new Direct3D video output driver. It is integrated within !QuarkPlayer installer under Windows.

=== Where do you get the MPlayer builds under Windows? ===
!QuarkPlayer integrates builds from Sherpya: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mplayer-win32/

=== Incorrect length of VBR mp3 files with the MPlayer backend ===
This is a known issue, cf http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.mplayer.devel/42003
There is no solution since the patch was refused by the MPlayer developers.
The best is to encode your mp3 files using Lame at 320 kbps CBR or to use FLAC.

=== No CD audio support with the MPlayer backend ===
This is a known issue of MPlayer. CD audio support works only under UNIX.
Same for the !DirectShow backend: there is no CD audio support.

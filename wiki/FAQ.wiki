Here some common answers to common questions.

If you are using the MPlayer backend, you can check [http://smplayer.wiki.sourceforge.net/FAQ SMPlayer FAQ], you will find useful informations since SMPlayer uses MPlayer

=== Which backend for which use? ===
Under Windows, for video playback, I currently recommend the MPlayer backend. For music playback I recommend the !DirectShow backend.
Under Linux, the recommended backend is Xine.

=== Aero (Windows Vista) is disabled with the MPlayer backend ===
This is a known issue, cf http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.mplayer.devel/48973

There is no "clear" solution yet, try to use MPlayer gl/gl2 output driver or even another Phonon backend.

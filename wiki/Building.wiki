=Introduction=

This document explains how to build and install phonon-vlc-mplayer under Windows and GNU/Linux.
Sometimes it can be hard to compile phonon-vlc-mplayer as I need to use the latest versions of the depending libraries.
Please check that you have the right Qt and Phonon versions otherwise it probably won't compile!

=Requirements=

 * OS: GNU/Linux, Windows
 * Tested under: Windows XP SP2, Ubuntu Hardy 8.04
 * Language: C++
 * License: GNU LGPL
 * Dependencies:
   * Qt: >= Qt-4.4.0 (or KDE-4.1)
      * Website: http://trolltech.com/
      * Download link: ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/
   * Phonon: >= Phonon KDE 4.1 (given with phonon-vlc-mplayer to make it easy)
      * Website: http://kde.org/
   * CMake: >= CMake-2.6.0
      * Website: http://cmake.org/
      * Download link: http://cmake.org/HTML/Download.html
   * Compiler: GCC or Visual C++ 2005 (MSVC8)

==GNU/Linux==

If Qt-4.4 is not present on your distribution (libqt4-devel packages), you will have to compile Qt-4.4.
Please refer to the links above for downloading and installing Qt-4.4

==MinGW==

 * Install Qt-4.4 compiled for MinGW: [http://ftp.ntua.gr/pub/X11/Qt/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-4.4.0-mingw.exe qt-win-opensource-4.4.0-mingw.exe]

Qt-4.4 already contains a simple way to install MinGW.
Be aware that MinGW version of Qt-4.4 does not come with Phonon. This is not an issue since phonon-vlc-mplayer comes with its own Phonon SVN copy.

(For the little story, the default Windows backend for Phonon is based on !DirectShow 9 and MinGW is not capable of compiling DS9 code,
that's why Trolltech doesn't ship Phonon with Qt-4.4 MinGW)

==Visual C++ 2005 (MSVC8)==

(Informations taken from [http://techbase.kde.org/index.php?title=Getting_Started/Build/KDE4/Windows/MS_Visual_Studio#Visual_Studio_2005_Express_Edition KDE TechBase])

If you want to compile phonon-vlc-mplayer under Windows, you need to install Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Express Edition (or whatever edition of Visual C++ 2005/2008).
Warning: the whole process is quite long and uneasy.

 * Install Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition: http://www.microsoft.com/express/2005/download/default.aspx
 * Install Platform SDK: [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0baf2b35-c656-4969-ace8-e4c0c0716adb&DisplayLang=en link]
 * Install Service Pack 1 for Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition (probably not needed, please tell me if it works without): [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7b0b0339-613a-46e6-ab4d-080d4d4a8c4e&DisplayLang=en link]
 * Install DirectX SDK (probably not needed, please tell me if it works without): [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=572BE8A6-263A-4424-A7FE-69CFF1A5B180&displaylang=en link]
 * Install CMake (see links above)

You need to setup you compiling environment, I use this small script: [http://code.google.com/p/phonon-vlc-mplayer/source/browse/wiki/setenv.bat setenv.bat].
Adapt this script to fit your own needs. You have to run it from a 'Command prompt' each time you want to compile something using Visual C++ 2005.

When all this is done properly, you will be able to compile Qt-4.4 (see links above) and then phonon-vlc-mplayer.
(Qt-4.4 Windows binaries can be found here: http://qt.windows.binaries.googlepages.com/index.html)

==MacOS X==

I didn't try phonon-vlc-mplayer under MacOS X (I don't have an Apple computer).
However, VLC and MPlayer run under MacOS X and 99% of phonon-vlc-mplayer source code is multiplatform and depends only on Qt. I guess you will need to modify CMakeLists.txt files.

==Compiling the latest Phonon library==

If you use KDE-4.1, then you have the latest Phonon library and phonon-vlc-mplayer will use it.
Qt-4.4 contains an old version of Phonon, that's why phonon-vlc-mplayer ships with its own copy of Phonon SVN.

==VLC Phonon backend==

 * Dependencies
   * Same as above +
   * VLC: VLC-0.9 (git trunk)
      * Website: http://www.videolan.org/
      * Developers infos: http://wiki.videolan.org/Developers_Corner
      * Download link: http://nightlies.videolan.org/

VLC Phonon backend uses libvlc (http://wiki.videolan.org/Libvlc) in order to control VLC.
It currently works under Windows and Linux by loading libvlc-control.(dll|so) at runtime.
You must install a VLC nightly build, there is no need to install vlc-devel packages.

==MPlayer Phonon backend==

 * Dependencies
   * Same as above +
   * MPlayer: >= MPlayer-1.0rc2
      * Website: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/
      * Developers infos: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/tech/slave.txt
      * Download link: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html

MPlayer Phonon backend runs the MPlayer (mplayer.exe under Windows) process in slave mode.

 * Under GNU/Linux, you should get a MPlayer package with your favorite GNU/Linux distribution

 * Under Windows, install [http://smplayer.sourceforge.net/ SMPlayer] that comes with a Windows build of MPlayer. phonon-mplayer looks for {{{C:/Program Files/SMPlayer/mplayer/mplayer.exe}}}, I have to improve this code, if you have some ideas please tell me.

=Get the source code=

 * Linux
You need to install [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion], and then enter this command line:
{{{svn co http://phonon-vlc-mplayer.googlecode.com/svn/ phonon-vlc-mplayer}}}

 * Windows
Under Windows, I recommend to install [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN].
Then right click on an empty directory and select {{{SVN Checkout...}}} and enter {{{http://phonon-vlc-mplayer.googlecode.com/svn/trunk}}}

http://phonon-vlc-mplayer.googlegroups.com/web/phonon-vlc-mplayer-tortoisesvn.png?gda=2qH30VMAAADzGcJ2Wp_dML5pKvawJMYJk78pZsf9cl0k95O_fFnkOmG1qiJ7UbTIup-M2XPURDTf-EQHMgtRDQmqKfqDX3niD-A81HbH9qxuvAXiTpBThAKOZFcal87Qff7gkugrF_g&gsc=-sR1VgsAAABMDwMWexEhpE3I217pOobO

=How to build=

Warning: be sure that your Qt installation matches the way you compile vlc-mplayer i.e if Qt is in debug mode, vlc-mplayer should be compiled in debug mode too. You cannot mix vlc-mplayer in release mode and Qt in debug mode (you will get an error message: "backend cannot be loaded" when running vlc-mplayer).

 * Under GNU/Linux:
{{{
cd trunk
cd build
./build_make-debug.sh
make
make install
make package
}}}

 * Under Windows:
{{{
cd trunk
cd build
build_nmake-debug.bat
nmake
nmake install
nmake package
}}}

For generating a Visual C++ 2005 project, there is {{{build/build_projectmsvc8-debug.bat}}}, however I recommend the process above.

You can also generate Debian, RPM, NSIS, ZIP... packages using command: {{{make package}}}

=Run the Phonon backends=

Qt looks for a specific location where Phonon .(dll|so) plugins are installed. Qt will load the first plugin found from this location.
Check Qt Plugins !HowTo: http://doc.trolltech.com/main-snapshot/plugins-howto.html

KDE allows you to configure the Phonon backend you want to use via the command {{{systemsettings}}}.
Qt comes with the program {{{qtconfig}}} under GNU/Linux that let's you configure your Phonon backend.

Currenlty, Phonon backends have to be recompiled either for KDE or for Qt, that's why you will find some KDE4_FOUND defines in phonon-vlc-mplayer code (Backend.cpp and CMakeLists.txt)

Qt looks for Phonon plugins inside {{{$QTDIR/plugins/phonon_backend}}} and {{{$APPDIR/phonon_backend}}}

=Use phonon-vlc-mplayer with your own Qt application=

Copy phonon-vlc.(dll|so) or phonon-mplayer.(dll|so) inside {{{MYAPP/phonon_backend/}}}

It is not possible to do a {{{Phonon::setPreferredBackend("backend my app need")}}} inside your Qt application.

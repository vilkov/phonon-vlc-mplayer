==More testing==

More testing with various file format is needed.

==Advanced features in libvlc-control==

libvlc-control lacks some features like advanced subtitles/chapters/angles/audio channels support.
It also lacks audio and video filters support.
That is why VLC backend is behind MPlayer backend support.

==MPlayer grey video window sometimes==

I've noticed that MPlayer video window can be grey sometimes.
Specially when I downclock my video card (NVidia) under Windows.
+ MPlayer is very slow compare to VLC in this case.

==Add !VolumeFaderEffectClass, !AudioDataOutputClass, !VisualizationClass, !VideoDataOutputClass from Backend.cpp==

See code here: http://code.google.com/p/phonon-vlc-mplayer/source/browse/trunk/phonon-vlc-mplayer/Backend.cpp

==Add audio/video device selection (object description)==

See code here: http://code.google.com/p/phonon-vlc-mplayer/source/browse/trunk/phonon-vlc-mplayer/Backend.cpp

==Allow backends initialization with user parameters==
